Hiding from the rain and snow
Trying to forget but I won't let go
Looking at a crowded street
Listening to my own heart beat
So many people all around the world
Tell me where do I find someone like you girl
Take me to your heart
Take me to your soul
Give me your hand before I'm old
Show me what love is haven't got a clue
Show me that wonders can be true
They say nothing lasts forever
We're only here today
Love is now or never
Bring me far away
Take me to your heart
Take me to your soul
Give me your hand and hold me
Show me what love is be my guiding star
It's easy take me to your heart
Standing on a mountain high
Looking at the moon through a clear blue sky
I should go and see some friends
But they don't really comprehend
Don't need too much talking without saying anything
All I need is someone who makes me wanna sing
Take me to your heart
Take me to your soul
Give me your hand before I'm old
Show me what love is haven't got a clue
Show me that wonders can be true
They say nothing lasts forever
We're only here today
Love is now or never
Bring me far away
Take me to your heart
Take me to your soul
Give me your hand and hold me
Show me what love is be my guiding star
It's easy take me to your heart
Take me to your heart
Take me to your soul
Give me your hand and hold me
Show me what love is be my guiding star
It's easy take me to your heart
It's easy take me to your heart„ÄÅ
